Problem Title: Single Number

Problem Description: Given a non-empty array of integers where every element appears twice except for one, find that single one.

Example:

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Explanation:

In the first example, the number 1 is the only one that appears once, so the function should return 1.

In the second example, all numbers except 4 appear twice, so the function should return 4.

Solution Approach:

This problem can be efficiently solved using bitwise XOR (^) operation. The XOR operation has the property that if you XOR two identical numbers, the result is 0, and XORing any number with 0 results in the same number. Therefore, if you XOR all the elements in the array together, the result will be the single number because all the duplicates will cancel each other out.

Here's the Python code to solve this problem:

def singleNumber(nums):
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result
This code iterates through the array and XORs all the numbers together. The final value of result will be the single number that appears only once.

This problem is a good example of a real-world application of bit manipulation, as it efficiently finds a unique element in an array of duplicates.
