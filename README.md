Algorithms and Data Structure<br>

If you are the beginner to data structure and algorithms, I recommend the following videos from Free Code Camp.
1. Algorithms and Data Structures Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners: https://youtu.be/8hly31xKli0
2. Data Structures Easy to Advanced Course - Full Tutorial from a Google Engineer: https://youtu.be/RBSGKlAvoiM
And you must know about Big O Notation.

### First Part
1. array
   Time and Space Complexity of Array:\
   **Traversing**\
   Traversing Array: Time Complexity O(n), Space Complexity O(1)\
   **Insertion**\
   Inserting the element to the first position of the Arrray: Time Complexity O(n)\
   Inserting the element to the last position of the arry: Time Complexity O(n) if the array is static O(1) if the array is dynamic, \
   Inserting the element (not first and last): Time Complexity O(n)\
   **Deletion**\
   Deleting the first element from an array: Time Complexity O(n)\
   Deleting the last element from an array: Time Complexity O(1)\
   Deleting an element in the middle of the array: Time Complexity O(n)\
   **Copying**\
   Copying array: Time Complexity O(n) Space Complexity O(n)  \
   **Accessing**\
   Accessing an element at a given index: Time Complexity O(1) Space Complexity O(1)\
   **Updating**
   Updating and element at a given index: Time Complexity O(1)
2. matrix
3. string
 Time and Space Complexity of Array:\
   **Traversing**\
   Traversing String: Time Complexity O(n), Space Complexity O(1)\
   **Copying**\
   Copying string: Time Complexity O(n) Space Complexity O(n)\
    **Accessing**\
   Accessing an element at a given index: Time Complexity O(1) Space Complexity O(1)
   
   Time Complexity of O(n*m) n is the number of words, m is the the max length of the words
   Space Complexity also O(n*m) if there can be any length of the word, it would be more accurate if we contains m
   words = ["cat", "dog", "cow"]
   ans = []
   for i in words:
       reveresed_word = i[::-1]
       ans.append(i)
       
       
   
4. linked-list

5. tree
   Tree is a type of graph. Common Types of Trees: Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree, Min Heap, Max Heap, Tries
7. graph
   Vertices are values and edges are connection.

### Second Part
1. sliding window
2. bit manipulation
3. stack/ queue
4. dictionary
5. recursion and dynamic programming.

# Some Patterns
1. Tree (Use Stack or Queue or recursive)
2. Zero Sum ()


# Other Notes
Time Complexity of finding the length of array or string in Python is O(1) not O(n).

Time complexity of copying a string is O(n**2) not O(n). (Generally, but can be different based on the programming language)


### To Start With
1. Two Sum
2. Binary Search
3. Move Zeros
4. Remove Element
5. First Bad Version
6. Reverse String
